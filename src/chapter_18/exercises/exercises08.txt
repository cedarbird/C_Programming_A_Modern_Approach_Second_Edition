(a) x is an array of ten pointers to functions. Each function takes
    an int argument and returns a character.
(b) x is a function that returns a pointer to an array of five integers.
(c) x is a function with no arguments that returns a pointer to
    a function with an int argument that returns a pointer to a float value.
(d) x is a function with two arguments. The first argument is an integer,
   and the second is a pointer to a function with an int argument and no return value.
   x returns a pointer to a function with an int argument and no return value.
   (Although this example may seem artificially complex, the signal function—part of
   the standard C library—has exactly this prototype. See p. 632 for a discussion of signal.)
